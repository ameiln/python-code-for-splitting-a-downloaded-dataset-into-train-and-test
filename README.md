# python-code-for-splitting-a-downloaded-dataset-into-train-and-test
We sometimes download a dataset of images that is not split into train and test. However, the dataset includes some .meta files which have already indexed images as 'train' or 'test' data. this project uses the .meta and .json files and splits the dataset into train and test folders.
